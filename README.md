# Waste Classifier AI Model

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end solution for automatic waste classification using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. The model is designed to differentiate between recyclable and organic (compostable) waste images, addressing the need for scalable, accurate, and automated waste sorting. This significantly reduces manual labor, increases recycling rates, and helps streamline waste management processes.

The repository contains two main notebooks:
- **Fruit Class Transfer Learning (work-in-progress):** Used to experiment with transfer learning and classification tasks on fruit images, serving as a base for model design and experimentation.
- **Waste Classifier with Transfer Learning (final model):** Implements a robust classifier for real-world waste images using transfer learning and custom deep learning architectures.

## Real-World Implications

The Waste Classifier AI Model directly addresses the challenges of manual waste sorting by automating the classification of waste images. This has several key benefits:

- **Scalability:** Enables large-scale, real-time waste sorting in recycling facilities.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces human error and labor costs.
- **Environmental Impact:** Improves recycling rates, reduces landfill waste, and helps cities and companies achieve sustainability targets.
- **Adaptability:** The approach can be extended to classify other waste types, or adapted for use in robotics, IoT smart bins, or mobile waste sorting apps.
